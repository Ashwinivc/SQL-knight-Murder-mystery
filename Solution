14887	       I heard a gunshot and then saw a man run out. He had a "Get Fit Now Gym" bag. The membership number on the bag started with "48Z".
              Only gold members have those bags. The man got into a car with a plate that included "H42W".
              
16371	       I saw the murder happen, and I recognized the killer from my gym when I was working out last week on January the 9th.

transcript
I was hired by a woman with a lot of money. I don't know her name but I know she's around 5'5" (65") or 5'7" (67"). 
She has red hair and she drives a Tesla Model S. I know that she attended the SQL Symphony Concert 3 times in December 2017.

from person p 
join facebook_event_checkin fb

on p.license_id = d.id

d.car_make = 'Tesla' and
